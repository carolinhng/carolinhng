- 👋 Hi, my name is Caroline Nguyen!
- 👀 When I'm not coding, I like to play sports, travel when I can, observe the sky with my telescope and enjoy nature while hiking.
- 🌱 I am currently learning Ruby and Javascript.
- 💞️ I am currently looking for a permanent job as a Fullstack developer in Bordeaux, France.
- 📫 How to contact me? By email to the address: caroline.ng.pro@hotmail.com
- ⚡ Some facts about me: I love eating, I love cats, I like partying because you have to let go! I can be determined and sometimes a little too narrow-minded when setting goals.
